    Fluorescence intensity assays.
items:
  - templateId: AMC_MCA_SUBSTRATE
    name: FRET (AMC/MCA substrate)
    description: |
      Detect fluorescence of 7-amino-4 methylcoumarin (AMC) generated by cleavage of methylcoumarinamide substrates. The primary readout is the increase in fluorescence signal during the reaction time. The initial fluorescence signal reflects the autofluorescence of the perturbagen. However, if this signal is too high, it becomes difficult to distinguish between enzyme reaction inhibition by the perturbagen and fluorescence quenching, so the assay should be considered invalid.
